Say goodbye to the unsightly ends of your Y-axis MGN12 linear rails with these delightful bumpstop endcaps, replete with tiny ZeroG logo.

These also serve a functional purposes of making sure your linear rail carriages cannot de-rail, avoiding a messy train crash.

The 'stopper' is held in place with an M3x10mm bolt and t-nut. (If you do not have any M3 t-nuts handy, there are many printable options on Thingiverse that will convert an M3 hex nut into a t-nut.)

The 'cover' then slides over the 'stopper', hiding the bolt and completing the arrangement. 

The 'cover' has a 1mm overhang onto the rail, given a lot of Chinese linear rails do not have nice straight ends, so you will lose 1mm of travel at each end you use the bumpstop caps.

The 'covers' can be printed (oriented as they are used) without supports assuming your printer can manage short bridges. 

You may be able print the 'stoppers' without supports (oriented as they are used) if your printer can manage decent overhangs. Mine can't when printing ABS, so I printed the stoppers upside down with a small support from build plate where the inset is for the head of the M3 bolt.
