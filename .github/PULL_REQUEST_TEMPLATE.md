<!--
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ZeroG  repository, it is
highly appreciated!

**Please make sure the submission conforms to the rules outlined below. PRs which fail
to conform to the rules below are likely to be rejected.**
-->

  * [ ] The mod, firmware or slicer profile is in the correct category
    folder. Printable mods go to `Mercury One/`, slicer profiles go to `slicer_profiles/`.
    Create a subfolder with your name, and place the mods in a subfolder with
    a descriptive name within that folder, e.g.: `/Mercury_One/FHeilmann/flux_capacitor`
  * [ ] Folders names MUST NOT contain spaces. If possible, make sure file names also 
    do not contain any spaces.
  * [ ] For each mod, add a small `README.md` file to its folder with a short description
    of what the mod accomplishes. This readme can be used to add pictures, give assembly
    instructions or specify a bill of materials if the mod requires additional hardware.
  * [ ] The PR modifies the top-level `README.md` of the category folder adding the 
    contribution to the table. Read the top part of the file for instructions on how
    to do this. Please preserve the alphabetical ordering while adding new rows.
  * [ ] The mod/profile has been tested by the person submitting the mod 
    and/or other ZeroG users. Make sure to add information about how the mod was tested below. 
  * [ ] The mod is not merely a slight modification of an official ZeroG part profile
	(i.e. an official ZeroG part with a few mm added or removed or a slicer profile 
    which only modifies a few values). *(When in doubt, contact one of the admins in the 
    ZeroG discord before submitting the PR)*
  * [ ] Submitted STLs are printable without support. *(If the mod does not meet this criterion
    join the ZeroG discord and ask the other users for advice on how to modify the mod such 
    that it does not require supports)*
  * [ ] Submitted STL files are not corrupt. *(This can be tested by opening the STL in PrusaSlicer or SuperSlicer
    and checking if mesh errors are reported.)*
  * [ ] Submitted STL files are oriented and scaled properly for printing.
  * [ ] Submitted slicer profiles contain no sensitive data (e.g. API keys).
